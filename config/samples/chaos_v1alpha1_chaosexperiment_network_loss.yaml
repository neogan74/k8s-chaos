spec:
  # Inject packet loss into pods using tc netem
  action: "pod-network-loss"

  # Target namespace
  namespace: "staging"

  # Target web application pods
  selector:
    app: web-app
    tier: frontend

  # Apply packet loss to 2 pods
  count: 2

  # Duration of network loss injection
  # Format: combinations of numbers with units (s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours)
  # Examples: "30s", "5m", "1h30m"
  duration: "2m"

  # Packet loss percentage (1-40%, default: 5)
  # Percentage of packets that will be dropped
  lossPercentage: 10

  # Loss correlation percentage (0-100%, default: 0)
  # Higher values make packet losses cluster together (burst losses)
  # 0 = independent random losses, 25 = some correlation, 50+ = high correlation
  lossCorrelation: 25

  # Optional: ExperimentDuration defines how long the experiment runs before auto-stopping
  # Uncomment to enable duration-based lifecycle (auto-stop after 15 minutes)
  # experimentDuration: "15m"

  # Optional: Retry configuration
  # maxRetries: 3
  # retryBackoff: "exponential"
  # retryDelay: "30s"

  # Optional: Safety features
  # dryRun: false                # Preview affected resources without executing
  # maxPercentage: 30            # Limit to 30% of matching pods
  # allowProduction: false       # Require explicit approval for production namespaces
