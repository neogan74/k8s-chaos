  # Stress CPU resources in pods
  action: "pod-cpu-stress"

  # Target namespace
  namespace: "staging"

  # Target API service pods
  selector:
    app: api-service
    tier: backend

  # Stress 2 pods to test CPU resilience
  count: 2

  # Duration of CPU stress
  # Format: combinations of numbers with units (s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours)
  # Examples: "30s", "5m", "1h30m"
  duration: "5m"

  # CPU load percentage (1-100)
  # 80 means 80% CPU utilization per worker
  cpuLoad: 80

  # Number of CPU workers (optional, default: 1)
  # Total CPU usage = cpuLoad * cpuWorkers / 100 cores
  # Example: 2 workers at 80% = up to 1.6 cores
  cpuWorkers: 2

  # Optional: ExperimentDuration defines how long the experiment runs before auto-stopping
  # Uncomment to enable duration-based lifecycle (auto-stop after 15 minutes)
  # experimentDuration: "15m"

  # Optional: Retry configuration
  # maxRetries: 3
  # retryBackoff: "exponential"
  # retryDelay: "30s"

  # Optional: Safety features
  # dryRun: false                # Preview affected resources without executing
  # maxPercentage: 30            # Limit to 30% of matching pods
  # allowProduction: false       # Require explicit approval for production namespaces
