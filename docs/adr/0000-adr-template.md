## How to Use This Template

1. Copy this file and rename to `XXXX-descriptive-name.md` where XXXX is the next sequential number
2. Update the title to be concise but descriptive (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL for Metrics Storage")
3. Fill in all sections - don't skip any, they all provide value
4. Status starts as "Proposed" until team review, then becomes "Accepted"
5. Keep ADRs immutable - if you need to change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
6. Date should be when the decision is accepted, not when the ADR is created
7. Store in `docs/adr/` directory
